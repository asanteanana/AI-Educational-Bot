#AI Educational Q&A Bot
This project is designed to make learning more accessible and engaging by combining AI-generated responses with natural-sounding text-to-speech (TTS) technology. The goal is to create a tool that supports diverse learners, including those who rely on auditory learning or need an alternative way to engage with educational content.

###Why This Matters
Education should be accessible to everyone. Whether someone prefers listening over reading, has visual impairments, or simply wants a more interactive learning experience, this project is built to help bridge that gap. By integrating AI and speech technology, we hope to make information more approachable, clear, and engaging.
